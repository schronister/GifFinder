# GifFinder

This simple program provides an interface for users to search the Giphy database for gifs. A selection of sample searches are preset in buttons across the top of the screen, and an input field allows users to add more.  When a button is selected, the top 10 gifs for that topic are displayed as still images, which can then be clicked to play the gif.  The focus of this project was to gain more experience using public APIs.
